# Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Template

A stripped-down starter based on the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) Jekyll theme, cleaned up for quick customization and deployment to GitHub Pages.

## 📌 Purpose
This repository serves as a barebones starting point for building your own Jekyll site using the Minimal Mistakes theme without extra sample content or development files.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Start with the template
You can create a new repository using this template by clicking the "Use this template" button on the GitHub repository page.

### 2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name
```

### 3. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Ruby and Bundler installed:
```bash
bundle install
```

### 4. Run locally
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Your site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

## 💡 Usage
- Edit `_config.yml` to set your site title, description, URL, and author information.
- Add blog posts in the `_posts/` directory (`YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`).
- Add static pages in the `_pages/` directory.
- Store images in `assets/images/`.

## 🚀 Deployment to GitHub Pages
1. Push your changes to a GitHub repository.
2. Enable **GitHub Pages** in repository settings, using the `main` branch.
3. Your site will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo`.
